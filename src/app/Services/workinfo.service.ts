My focus has been on the entire technology stack, with a passion for making our UI/UX more aligned to our users needs.",
        "descrippartwo": "I bring expertise to our front-end when most engineers focus on backend services. I work closely with our Product Owner to make sure our site is designed with a mobile-first approach and has a seamless responsive design for any form factor. I maintain a custom Sass and Angular Material library that is implemented globally across our frontend Nx Monorepo. I also maintain our NgXs (similar to NgRx) store pattern, while pushing a reactive programming approach across the entire Angular application.",
        "descripparthree": "Also, I regularly work in our .NET backend. I help maintain and add functionality to one of our seven services that powers our front-end. Our externally exposed services are built with a controller-service-repository pattern to separate concerns and provide clear responsibility at each layer, while our non-exposed services communicate via a Command/Event architecture where we use NServiceBus and RabbitMQ to facilitate messaging."
